# Tech Support Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Tech Support Chatbot using a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) on a technical support dataset. The chatbot is trained to assist users with common technical issues by providing accurate and relevant responses.

## Team Contributions
Each team member contributed equally to the following aspects of the project:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering and cleaning the dataset, applying data augmentation techniques, and tokenizing inputs for training. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/tech-support-conversations-dataset?resource=download)
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Implementing and fine-tuning an LLM for chatbot responses, adjusting hyperparameters, and optimizing for performance.
- **Evaluation & Performance Metrics**: Assessing the chatbot using loss functions, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Resolving issues related to GPU memory, dataset compatibility, and model inference errors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- CUDA for GPU acceleration
